xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \\n\\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \\n\\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \\n\\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is one of the xxunk and most feel - good romantic comedies ever made . xxmaj there 's just no getting around that , and it 's hard to actually put one 's feeling for this film into words . xxmaj it 's not one of those films that tries too hard , nor does it come up with the xxunk possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end . xxmaj in fact , all its charm is xxunk , contained within the characters and the setting and the plot … which is highly believable to xxunk . xxmaj it 's easy to think that such a love story , as beautiful as any other ever told , * could * happen to you … a feeling you do n't often get from other romantic comedies , however sweet and heart - warming they may be . \\n\\n xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik ( james xxmaj stewart ) and xxmaj clara xxmaj xxunk ( margaret xxmaj xxunk ) do n't have the most xxunk of first xxunk when she arrives in the shop ( matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. ) he 's been working in for the past nine years , asking for a job . xxmaj they clash from the very beginning , mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it 's opened -- he thinks it 's a ludicrous idea ; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired . xxmaj their bickering takes them through the next six months , even as they both ( xxunk , of course ! ) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through xxup xxunk xxmaj box xxunk . xxmaj this would be a pretty thin xxunk to base an entire film on , except that xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is xxunk xxunk - out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the xxunk but lonely xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek ( frank xxmaj morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; xxmaj xxunk ( felix xxmaj xxunk ) , xxmaj kralik 's sidekick and friend who always xxunk out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; xxunk pimp - du - xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( joseph xxmaj xxunk ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a xxunk righteous xxmaj kralik ; and ambitious xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( william xxmaj tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of xxunk for xxmaj matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. xxmaj the xxunk love story between ' dear xxmaj friends ' is played out in this little shop in xxmaj budapest , xxmaj hungary , in which xxmaj kralik 's xxunk xxunk and subsequent xxunk to shop manager help the two xxunk - to - be along . xxmaj it 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well - developed , and xxmaj matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one xxmaj alfred and xxmaj clara share . xxmaj his xxunk to new xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk ( charles xxmaj smith ) for xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve dinner , made in the xxunk , beautiful snow of a xxmaj hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it is n't this film 's business to tell . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from the love story , i must say that xxmaj james xxmaj stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . xxmaj he does n't play the full - xxunk xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' mr xxmaj smith xxmaj goes xxmaj to xxmaj washington ' for that ) ; in fact xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik is xxunk and abrupt and not particularly kind . xxmaj he 's rather a xxunk man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the xxunk - xxunk down - home xxunk charm xxmaj stewart would soon come to xxunk . xxmaj when he finds out before xxmaj clara that they have been xxunk in secret , in fact , xxmaj kralik does n't ' xxunk up -- he xxunk it out to see how far he can take the xxunk , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with xxmaj clara as boss and xxunk ) that loving the person he knows through the xxunk letters might not xxunk with loving the person herself . xxmaj his description to xxmaj clara of the fictional xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( what a name ! ) who was to become her xxunk is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters do n't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters do n't reveal all there is to her . xxmaj stewart plays this role perfectly -- he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever xxmaj clara insults xxmaj mr . xxmaj kralik , as she is often wo nt to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . xxmaj and yet one believes , underneath the xxunk and xxunk , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much xxunk and xxunk and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . \\n\\n xxmaj special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk xxunk rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing - shop scene on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by xxmaj alfred 's most vivid description of her xxunk xxunk . xxmaj frank xxmaj morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to xxunk his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . xxmaj and xxmaj felix xxmaj xxunk plays the role of the meek but xxunk xxmaj xxunk wonderfully ( a xxmaj lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious xxmaj russian xxunk in xxunk particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend xxmaj alfred get the xxmaj christmas present the latter * really * wants … a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box xxmaj clara is so hung up on . \\n\\n xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lubitsch really does himself proud with this film -- for example , the famously xxunk and xxunk care given to detail in the creation of the xxmaj matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the xxmaj hungarian names on the door , the xxunk and the cash xxunk and so on . xxmaj but even though xxmaj lubitsch chose to have the story set in xxmaj hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . xxmaj xxunk lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . xxmaj the snow on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve is real as well , or at least as real as xxmaj lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . xxmaj it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be xxunk . ( no , not even in a remake like xxup you 've xxup got xxup mail . ) \\n\\n * this * is really the xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart xxmaj christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about xxup it 's a xxup wonderful xxup life . xxmaj not to xxunk from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner this xxmaj christmas instead . xxmaj it 's sweet , funny , charming , and xxmaj stewart is xxunk in his role . xxmaj we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could .</td>\n",

xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \\n\\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \\n\\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \\n\\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is one of the xxunk and most feel - good romantic comedies ever made . xxmaj there 's just no getting around that , and it 's hard to actually put one 's feeling for this film into words . xxmaj it 's not one of those films that tries too hard , nor does it come up with the xxunk possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end . xxmaj in fact , all its charm is xxunk , contained within the characters and the setting and the plot … which is highly believable to xxunk . xxmaj it 's easy to think that such a love story , as beautiful as any other ever told , * could * happen to you … a feeling you do n't often get from other romantic comedies , however sweet and heart - warming they may be . \\n\\n xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik ( james xxmaj stewart ) and xxmaj clara xxmaj xxunk ( margaret xxmaj xxunk ) do n't have the most xxunk of first xxunk when she arrives in the shop ( matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. ) he 's been working in for the past nine years , asking for a job . xxmaj they clash from the very beginning , mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it 's opened -- he thinks it 's a ludicrous idea ; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired . xxmaj their bickering takes them through the next six months , even as they both ( xxunk , of course ! ) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through xxup xxunk xxmaj box xxunk . xxmaj this would be a pretty thin xxunk to base an entire film on , except that xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is xxunk xxunk - out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the xxunk but lonely xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek ( frank xxmaj morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; xxmaj xxunk ( felix xxmaj xxunk ) , xxmaj kralik 's sidekick and friend who always xxunk out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; xxunk pimp - du - xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( joseph xxmaj xxunk ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a xxunk righteous xxmaj kralik ; and ambitious xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( william xxmaj tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of xxunk for xxmaj matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. xxmaj the xxunk love story between ' dear xxmaj friends ' is played out in this little shop in xxmaj budapest , xxmaj hungary , in which xxmaj kralik 's xxunk xxunk and subsequent xxunk to shop manager help the two xxunk - to - be along . xxmaj it 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well - developed , and xxmaj matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one xxmaj alfred and xxmaj clara share . xxmaj his xxunk to new xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk ( charles xxmaj smith ) for xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve dinner , made in the xxunk , beautiful snow of a xxmaj hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it is n't this film 's business to tell . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from the love story , i must say that xxmaj james xxmaj stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . xxmaj he does n't play the full - xxunk xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' mr xxmaj smith xxmaj goes xxmaj to xxmaj washington ' for that ) ; in fact xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik is xxunk and abrupt and not particularly kind . xxmaj he 's rather a xxunk man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the xxunk - xxunk down - home xxunk charm xxmaj stewart would soon come to xxunk . xxmaj when he finds out before xxmaj clara that they have been xxunk in secret , in fact , xxmaj kralik does n't ' xxunk up -- he xxunk it out to see how far he can take the xxunk , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with xxmaj clara as boss and xxunk ) that loving the person he knows through the xxunk letters might not xxunk with loving the person herself . xxmaj his description to xxmaj clara of the fictional xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( what a name ! ) who was to become her xxunk is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters do n't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters do n't reveal all there is to her . xxmaj stewart plays this role perfectly -- he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever xxmaj clara insults xxmaj mr . xxmaj kralik , as she is often wo nt to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . xxmaj and yet one believes , underneath the xxunk and xxunk , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much xxunk and xxunk and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . \\n\\n xxmaj special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk xxunk rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing - shop scene on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by xxmaj alfred 's most vivid description of her xxunk xxunk . xxmaj frank xxmaj morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to xxunk his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . xxmaj and xxmaj felix xxmaj xxunk plays the role of the meek but xxunk xxmaj xxunk wonderfully ( a xxmaj lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious xxmaj russian xxunk in xxunk particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend xxmaj alfred get the xxmaj christmas present the latter * really * wants … a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box xxmaj clara is so hung up on . \\n\\n xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lubitsch really does himself proud with this film -- for example , the famously xxunk and xxunk care given to detail in the creation of the xxmaj matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the xxmaj hungarian names on the door , the xxunk and the cash xxunk and so on . xxmaj but even though xxmaj lubitsch chose to have the story set in xxmaj hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . xxmaj xxunk lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . xxmaj the snow on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve is real as well , or at least as real as xxmaj lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . xxmaj it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be xxunk . ( no , not even in a remake like xxup you 've xxup got xxup mail . ) \\n\\n * this * is really the xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart xxmaj christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about xxup it 's a xxup wonderful xxup life . xxmaj not to xxunk from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner this xxmaj christmas instead . xxmaj it 's sweet , funny , charming , and xxmaj stewart is xxunk in his role . xxmaj we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could .</td>\n",

xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \\n\\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \\n\\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the \" revolutionaries \" , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that \" ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time \" . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant \" revolutionaries \" , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's \" woods \" and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( \" i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \\n\\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \\n\\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was \" uneven \" , xxmaj part2 actually \" goes rapidly downhill \" from there , \" xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail \" , which \" … feels almost unbearably slow and turgid \" . \\n\\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxmaj this film sat on my xxmaj xxunk for weeks before i watched it . i xxunk a self - indulgent xxunk flick about relationships gone bad . i was wrong ; this was an xxunk xxunk into the screwed - up xxunk of xxmaj new xxmaj xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj the format is the same as xxmaj max xxmaj xxunk ' \" la xxmaj xxunk , \" based on a play by xxmaj arthur xxmaj xxunk , who is given an \" inspired by \" credit . xxmaj it starts from one person , a prostitute , standing on a street corner in xxmaj brooklyn . xxmaj she is picked up by a home contractor , who has sex with her on the hood of a car , but ca n't come . xxmaj he refuses to pay her . xxmaj when he 's off xxunk , she answers his cell phone and takes a message . xxmaj she runs away with his keys . \\n\\n xxmaj then the story switches to the contractor , who pays a professional call on a rich , bored xxmaj new xxmaj york woman , who plays with him until he is xxunk , then she pulls away . xxmaj she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is ; he tells her how beautiful she is , and lucky . xxmaj as he is leaving , she asks if he would have sex with her . xxmaj she sits on top of him , xxunk up and down . xxmaj this time he comes , the he leaves . \\n\\n xxmaj the woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their xxunk friends . xxmaj xxunk ( robert ) is talking business , wife ( ellen ) is bored , and switches the subject to sex , and how often men and women think about it . xxmaj husband switches conversation to desert . xxmaj later , after the xxunk leave , xxmaj ellen tries to entice xxmaj robert into sex . xxmaj robert wants none of it , and puts on a jazz record . xxmaj ellen turns on the radio ; xxmaj robert turns up the music ; xxmaj ellen turns on the xxup tv ; xxmaj robert turns on another xxup tv . xxmaj xxunk ensues . xxmaj ellen goes up on the roof , xxmaj robert joins her . xxmaj ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men , men other than xxmaj robert . xxmaj robert says that he too needs to experience men . \\n\\n xxmaj we next follow xxmaj robert as he visits an artist , xxmaj martin , played by xxmaj steve xxmaj buscemi . i wish xxmaj buscemi could have more roles like this , where he is a sexy , smart , totally xxunk guy . xxmaj robert xxunk xxmaj martin 's work , much more than it deserves , xxunk to get it into a show . xxmaj martin is excited , until it turns out that xxmaj robert is speaking out of his xxunk , it is all a xxunk dance . xxmaj robert tries to kiss xxmaj martin , on the lips , and xxmaj martin pulls back , saying that he is not gay . xxmaj robert xxunk that he 's not gay either , xxmaj martin xxunk . xxmaj both admit that the xxunk are bad . xxmaj robert is about to leave , when xxmaj martin allows xxmaj robert to kiss him . xxmaj they make out , and xxmaj robert goes down on xxmaj martin . \\n\\n xxmaj next we follow xxmaj martin , as he xxunk for an art show at a xxmaj manhattan gallery . xxmaj he is xxunk by the xxunk , xxmaj anna , played by xxmaj rosario xxmaj dawson . ( i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1 xxrep 3 0 words ) … and they make love to each other . \\n\\n xxmaj we next follow xxmaj anna , who is sitting at a lunch stand . xxmaj her boyfriend , xxmaj nick ( adrian xxmaj xxunk ) , enters , bearing xxunk . xxmaj she is cold toward him ; he tries to figure out why . xxmaj he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco . xxmaj she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex - xxunk while in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco , and had sex with her . xxmaj the latter revelation turns out to be a lie . xxmaj the two of them make out in the xxunk , but she decides that they must break up . xxmaj nick is xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj and we follow xxmaj nick , who confesses his xxunk to an older woman who he meets on a park bench , xxmaj joey ( carol xxmaj kane ) . xxmaj joey is sort of weird and child - like , but is a good audience for xxmaj nick , who needs a sympathetic ear . xxmaj the two of them go to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj island at night , and look at the stars . xxmaj nick falls under xxmaj joey 's spell , despite the age difference between them . xxmaj they go back to xxmaj joey 's apartment , and xxmaj nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman . xxmaj she is on top of him , does n't want to let him go . xxmaj but he manages to escape . \\n\\n ( this is , by the way , the best xxmaj carol xxmaj kane role since she played xxmaj xxunk 's wife in xxmaj taxi . ) xxmaj joey 's phone rings , and it is a man calling the xxmaj psychic xxmaj friends xxmaj network , and xxmaj joey is one of the psychic friends . xxmaj although she is still hurting from xxmaj nick , she gradually gets into her psychic xxunk . xxmaj the man is at his office , late at night , and wants to have phone sex with her . xxmaj although that is not xxmaj joey 's business , xxmaj joey goes along , and coaxes the man to come . xxmaj she wants to keep talking , although the man want to get off the phone , and finds out that he has xxunk a lot of money from his company , and will be found out xxunk . xxmaj his life is ruined . xxmaj joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide , and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend , that she cares about him . xxmaj and she does care about him . \\n\\n xxmaj but the man packs a gun into his xxunk , and goes off to seek a prostitute on the xxmaj brooklyn xxunk , and we come back to the beginning , to the same prostitute who started out xxmaj la xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj she wants to give him $ xxunk , xxrep 3 0 in cash if she will kill him . xxmaj he tried to kill himself , but could n't do it . xxmaj the prostitute does not want to do it , but he insists , holding her hand , holding the gun inside his mouth , telling her where to aim . xxmaj eventually , the gun goes off , and we see the prostitute walking down the street , and xxunk at the corner where she normally does business . xxmaj the contractor who did n't pay her earlier in the movie drives up , xxunk down the window . xxmaj they look at each other . xxup the xxup end .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos i really wanted to love this show . i truly , honestly did . \\n\\n xxmaj for the first time , gay viewers get their own version of the \" the xxmaj bachelor \" . xxmaj with the help of his obligatory \" hag \" xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj james , a good looking , well - to - do thirty - something has the chance of love with 15 suitors ( or \" mates \" as they are referred to in the show ) . xxmaj the only problem is half of them are straight and xxmaj james does n't know this . xxmaj if xxmaj james picks a gay one , they get a trip to xxmaj new xxmaj zealand , and xxmaj if he picks a straight one , straight guy gets $ 25 , xxrep 3 0 . xxmaj how can this not be fun ? ! xxmaj take my hand , lets xxunk : \\n\\n xxmaj the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself . xxmaj james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body , the one you 'd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before xxunk for xxunk xxunk . xxmaj why they chose to cast xxmaj james as the leading man is beyond me . xxmaj god knows there 's so many other hotter and xxunk homosexual men out there dying to be on xxup tv . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from his rather average physical appearance , xxmaj james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk . xxmaj even as such , he has this arrogant , xxunk xxunk xxunk about him . xxmaj however , if xxmaj james were standing up against a blank , white wall he 'd xxunk right into in it . i honestly ca n't recall a single interesting or xxunk thing xxmaj james said during the course of the show . xxmaj he is xxup that boring and forgettable . xxmaj in fact , one of the mates flat out xxunk him he was n't feeling a connection . i thought that was the best part of the show . xxmaj also , xxmaj james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying xxunk . xxmaj sound feminine or sound xxunk , but do n't xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk xxunk in the middle of sentences … so painful to sit through . i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking , \" please choose a straight guy and xxunk yourself and your unfortunate looking hag \" \\n\\n xxmaj then we have the suitors . a remarkably bland bunch of men who do n't seem to care either way what is happening . xxmaj equally xxunk , they seem to be xxunk from one guy to the next except , \" hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair \" xxmaj again , xxunk inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show . xxmaj while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles , it would 've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these xxunk drones . xxmaj however , in all their xxunk they still manage to upstage xxmaj james ( which is n't all that hard to do anyway ) , slightly that is . xxmaj you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man . xxmaj and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around xxup each xxup other than with the leading man ? xxmaj very sad . \\n\\n xxmaj also , i just thought that xxmaj i d point something mentioned on the message xxunk which i felt was actually true : the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys . \\n\\n xxmaj do n't get me wrong , xxmaj i m not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring , as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute . xxmaj it 's just that overall they were just xxup blah compared to the men you 'd see on shows like a xxmaj shot xxmaj at xxmaj love with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk . \\n\\n i do n't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show . i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box , i can accept the xxunk , xxunk suitors but xxup please for the love of xxmaj god entertain me just a little . xxmaj no such luck . \\n\\n xxmaj if you 're expecting drama , intrigue , xxunk , or excitement you will be xxup severely disappointed . xxmaj the biggest \" drama \" comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in xxmaj new xxmaj york ( how xxunk ! ) . xxmaj as xxunk as that may be i guarantee you , that is the xxup only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show . \\n\\n xxmaj sure there is the twist , but if you have any semblance of xxmaj xxunk in you , you 'll easily xxunk who 's who ( it was n't hard at all , i was only wrong once . ) xxmaj this show is stacking so much of its xxunk on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else . \\n\\n xxmaj we get to watch as xxmaj james &amp; xxmaj co xxunk along such exciting activities such as learning how to xxmaj western step dance , shopping for xxunk , visiting a xxunk xxunk , and gay xxunk . xxup yawn . xxmaj sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway . xxmaj that 's one of main problems with the show : xxup no xxup one seems to be enjoying themselves -- they are there just going through the motion trying xxunk hard to appear to have a good time . xxmaj and you really ca nt blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame . \\n\\n xxmaj finally , the physical aspect is not there . xxmaj there 's no xxunk , no xxunk , no kissing ( ! ) , no xxunk of any sort . xxmaj it 's just \" ok that was a boring date , xxmaj i m gon na go back to my ugly , tacky wanna - be xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk dwelling ( quick xxunk on the lips ) xxup xxunk . \" xxmaj this show is so xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk it 's ridiculous . i can understand them not wanting to play up the xxunk xxunk nature of homosexual men , but come the xxrep 4 * on . xxmaj people who watch reality xxup tv shows are gon na want more than xxunk xxunk and xxunk kisses . xxmaj this show refuses to compromise . \\n\\n xxmaj sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be xxunk . i do commend xxmaj bravo for first putting up a show of this nature , but the xxunk incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind xxunk . xxmaj to summarize my three points : xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring = go do something else . xxmaj you 'll have more fun waiting at a doctor 's office for an xxunk , at least they have interesting xxunk there .</td>\n",
