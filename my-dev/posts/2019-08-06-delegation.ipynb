    "The key to this approach is the use of `**kwargs`. In python `**kwargs` in a parameter like means \"put any additional keyword arguments into a dict called `kwarg`. And `**kwargs` in an argument list means \"insert all key/value pairs in the `kwargs` dict as named arguments here\". This approach is used in many popular libraries, such as `matplotlib`, in which the main `plot` function simply has the signature `plot(*args, **kwargs)`. The [plot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot) says \"*The `kwargs` are Line2D properties*\" and then lists those properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not just python that uses this approach. For instance, in the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) the equivalent to `**args` is simply written `...` (an *ellipsis*). The R documentation [explains](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#The-three-dots-argument): \"*Another frequent requirement is to allow one function to pass on argument settings to another. For example many graphics functions use the function par() and functions like plot() allow the user to pass on graphical parameters to par() to control the graphical output.This can be done by including an extra argument, literally ‚Äò‚Ä¶‚Äô, of the function, which may then be passed on*\".\n",

    "For more details on using `**kwargs` in python, Google will find you many nice tutorials, such as [this one](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-args-and-kwargs-in-python-3). The `**kwargs` solution appears to work quite nicely:"

    "I really can't overstate how significant this little decorator is to my coding practice. In early versions of fastai we used `kwargs` frequently for delegation, because we wanted to ensure my code was as simple as possible to write (otherwise I tend to make a lot of mistakes!) We used it not just for delegating `__init__` to the parent, but also for standard functions, similar to how it's used in matplotlib's `plot` function. However, as fastai got more popular, I heard more and more feedback along the lines of \"I love everything about fastai, except I hate dealing with kwargs\"! And I totally empathized; indeed, dealing with `...` in R APIs and `kwargs` in Python APIs has been a regular pain-point for me too. But here I was, inflicting it on my users! üòØ\n",

I tend to argue for readability over extensibility, and that's what I'll do here: for the love of whatever deity/ies you believe in, use `**kwargs` sparingly and document their use when you do*\". This is what we ended up doing in fastai too. Last year Sylvain spent a pleasant (!) afternoon removing every `kwargs` he could and replaced it with explicit parameter lists. And of course now we get the occassional bug resulting from one of us failing to update parameter defaults in all functions...\n",
